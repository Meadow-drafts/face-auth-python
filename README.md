## Features

- Face authentication using state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms.
- Secure and convenient user authentication through facial features.
- User-friendly interface for quick and reliable authentication.
- Supports integration with existing applications and systems.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the Face Authentication System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-auth-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory.
```bash
cd face-auth-python
```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


###Usage


Run the authenticate_face.py script to start the face authentication process.
The script captures an image or video feed from the camera, processes it using facial recognition, and determines the authenticity of the user.

```bash
python authenticate_face.py
```

Note: The Face Authentication System provides an additional layer of security but may not be foolproof. 
Use it as part of a comprehensive authentication strategy.
